# Research Document Reorganization Plan

**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Status**: Approved  
**Branch**: feature/code-quality-fixes (continuing current work)

## Overview

Reorganize the research agent documents to separate pure MCP protocol/SDK facts from implementation-biased suggestions, preserving valuable technical knowledge and code examples as reference options for future Claude instances.

## Phase 1: Archive Originals
- Create `docs/research/original/` directory
- Move all 5 research documents to `original/` subdirectory
- Preserve complete research agent output for reference

## Phase 2: Create Refined Documents

### Document 1: `mcp-protocol-2025-06-18.md`
**Approach:** Copy original and edit minimally
- Keep essentially all content (it's mostly pure protocol facts)
- Remove only overly prescriptive implementation guidance

### Document 2: `typescript-sdk-migration.md`
**Approach:** Copy original and edit selectively
- Keep all SDK compatibility info and code examples
- Keep migration patterns as reference options
- Remove only timeline/project management sections

### Document 3: `transport-architecture.md`
**Approach:** Copy original and keep most content
- Keep all transport technical details and examples
- Keep Streamable HTTP config (we'll need this)
- Keep security patterns as future options
- Remove very little - mostly just overly specific infrastructure

### Document 4: `multi-client-architecture.md`
**Approach:** Write new document from scratch
- Extract core MCP multi-client concepts and code snippets
- Keep fundamental session patterns as reference
- Remove complete server implementations and specific DB choices

### Document 5: `README.md` overview
**Approach:** Write new summary document
- Create clean overview of available reference information
- Focus on "here are your options" rather than "do this"

## Key Principle
Preserve technical knowledge and code examples as reference options. Remove prescriptive implementation decisions and project management aspects.

## Success Criteria
- All original research preserved in `original/` subdirectory
- Clean reference documents with pure protocol/SDK facts
- Technical patterns available as options, not requirements
- Future Claude instances have unbiased MCP knowledge base
