# MCP Research Documentation

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-27  
**Purpose**: Technical reference for Model Context Protocol (MCP) modernization

## Overview

This directory contains technical reference documentation for the Model Context Protocol specification 2025-06-18 and TypeScript SDK. These documents provide factual information about the protocol, SDK changes, and architectural patterns without prescriptive implementation guidance.

## üìö Documentation Index

### [MCP Protocol 2025-06-18](mcp-protocol-2025-06-18.md)
**Core protocol specification and breaking changes**

- Critical breaking changes from previous versions
- New features: structured tool outputs, enhanced OAuth security, user elicitation
- Transport architecture changes and requirements
- Tool implementation best practices and error handling patterns
- All code examples derived from official MCP specification

### [TypeScript SDK Migration](typescript-sdk-migration.md)  
**SDK upgrade reference from v1.7.0 to v1.17.4**

- Version analysis and compatibility matrix
- Transport layer migration patterns (stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP)
- Tool handler modernization with code examples
- Server architecture update patterns
- Testing and integration strategies

### [Transport Architecture](transport-architecture.md)
**Comprehensive transport mechanism reference**

- stdio vs Streamable HTTP transport comparison
- Implementation patterns and security considerations  
- Multi-client session management approaches
- Performance optimization strategies
- Universal transport patterns for development and production

### [Multi-Client Architecture](multi-client-architecture.md)
**Core concepts for multi-client MCP server design**

- Session-based state isolation patterns
- Transport abstraction principles
- Session management and connection handling
- Security considerations and access control
- Implementation trade-offs and use cases

## üéØ Using This Documentation

### For New Implementations
- Start with **MCP Protocol 2025-06-18** for current specification requirements
- Review **Transport Architecture** for transport mechanism options
- Consider **Multi-Client Architecture** if supporting multiple concurrent clients

### For Existing Server Modernization
- Begin with **TypeScript SDK Migration** for upgrade path
- Reference **MCP Protocol 2025-06-18** for breaking changes
- Use **Transport Architecture** for adding HTTP transport support

### Code Examples
All code examples in these documents are:
- ‚úÖ Derived from official MCP specification and SDK documentation
- ‚úÖ Provided as reference patterns and options
- ‚úÖ Technology-agnostic where possible
- ‚úÖ Focused on core concepts rather than specific implementations

## üîç Research Sources

### Official Documentation
- [MCP Specification 2025-06-18](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/)
- [MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
- [Anthropic MCP Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/mcp)

### Research Methodology
- Multi-source information gathering from official specifications
- Expert AI consultation for technical architecture patterns
- GitHub repository analysis for implementation examples
- Cross-reference validation across multiple sources

## üìã Key Takeaways

### MCP 2025-06-18 Protocol
- **JSON-RPC batching removed** - Use individual requests
- **SSE transport deprecated** - Migrate to Streamable HTTP for production
- **Protocol version headers required** - Include `MCP-Protocol-Version` in HTTP requests
- **Enhanced error handling** - Use `isError` flag in CallToolResult

### TypeScript SDK Evolution  
- **Strong backward compatibility** from v1.7.0 to v1.17.4
- **Transport layer changes** - New StreamableHTTPServerTransport class
- **Tool result format evolution** - CallToolResult interface recommended
- **Session management improvements** - Built-in session handling capabilities

### Architecture Options
- **stdio transport** - Excellent for development and desktop integration
- **Streamable HTTP** - Production-ready with multi-client support
- **Universal patterns** - Single codebase supporting both transports
- **Session management** - Optional but valuable for stateful applications

## üöÄ Implementation Approach

This documentation is designed to support **informed decision-making** rather than prescriptive implementation. Each document presents:

- **Technical facts** from official sources
- **Reference patterns** that can be adapted
- **Code examples** showing possible approaches  
- **Trade-offs** to inform architectural decisions

Future Claude instances should use this information to make implementation decisions based on specific project requirements rather than following predetermined paths.
